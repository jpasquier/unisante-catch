The aim of the study is to show that the proportion of people who agree to do the screening is higher in the experimental group than in the control group. Consents and refusals being measured within the families, the observations are not independent. Thus, it would be inappropriate to compare the consent rates of the control and experimental groups using a chi-square test. To account for the effect of clusters, proportions will be compared using a odds ratio that will be estimated using a logistic regression model. The latter will include the group as a fixed effect (the parameter of interest) and the family as a random effect. We calculated that it will be necessary to include 27 families per group to show a statistically significant difference between the two groups with a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, assuming that the consent rates for the control and experimental groups will be in mean equal to 0.5 respectively 0.7 and will be at 95% in the intervals [0.3,0.7] respectively [0.5,0.84] (same range on the logit scale) and that the number of contactable relatives will be in mean equal to 4. The sample size was calculated analytically based on the standard errors of the mean proportions and was verified using simulations.
